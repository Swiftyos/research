# RND: Generative AI and AI Agent Research

Welcome to my personal research into generative AI and AI Agent technology. This project aims to explore the capabilities and potential applications of these cutting-edge technologies.

The project is structured as follows:

- `rnd/agent`: This directory houses the AI agent's code, which includes memory management and decision-making capabilities.
- `rnd/images`: This directory is dedicated to the code responsible for generating images using generative AI techniques.
- `rnd/audioo`: This directory contains the code for audio processing and generation.
- `rnd/video`: This directory includes the code for video processing and generation.

Dependencies for this project are managed using Poetry and are listed in `pyproject.toml`.

Please feel free to explore the code and contribute to the project.
